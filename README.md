# Virtual Agent for Social Project Analysis

This repository presents the **Virtual Agent**, an artificial intelligence solution I developed to analyze data from social projects stored in an **Azure Blob Storage** container.

The core idea is to leverage the **Gemini model** to interpret **natural language requests**, perform data analysis functions, and provide **insights into the financial viability and social return** of early childhood education initiatives.

## How I built this project

The project is structured into **two main components**: a backend (hosted on **Google Cloud Run**) and a frontend (published on **GitHub Pages**).

### ðŸ”¹ Backend (`/virtual-agent`)

For the virtual agentâ€™s API, I developed with:

* **Python 3.9** as the main programming language.
* **Flask** to build the API that receives and processes frontend requests.
* **Google Gemini API** for conversational capabilities and tool execution.
* **Azure Storage Blob SDK** for integration with data stored in Azure.
* **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
* **python-dotenv** for loading environment variables (such as the API key).
* **flask-cors** for handling CORS policies.
* **Docker** to package and run the backend in a container.

ðŸ“‚ Main structure of the `virtual-agent` folder:

* `app.py` â†’ API logic, integration with the Gemini model, and tool definitions.
* `requirements.txt` â†’ required dependencies.
* `dockerfile.dockerfile` â†’ Docker image build instructions.
* `GOOGLE_APY_KEY.env` â†’ environment variables (not versioned).

The backend was deployed to **Google Cloud Run**, enabling automatic scaling and frontend communication.

### ðŸ”¹ Frontend (`/virtual_agent_frontend`)

The web interface was designed to be simple, interactive, and easily accessible:

* **React + Vite** for building and bundling the application.
* **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design and styling.
* **GitHub Pages** for free and convenient frontend hosting.

ðŸ“‚ Main structure of the `virtual_agent_frontend` folder:

* `app.jsx` â†’ React application code.
* `index.html` â†’ entry page that connects to the backend deployed on Cloud Run.

## Workflow

1. The user accesses the frontend hosted on **GitHub Pages**.
2. Requests are sent to the **backend on Google Cloud Run**.
3. The backend uses the **Gemini model** to interpret natural language queries.
4. Data is retrieved from **Azure Blob Storage** and processed with **Pandas**.
5. The agent returns results in a clear and user-friendly format.

## Key Learnings

Throughout development, I worked with:

* Integration between different cloud services (**Google Cloud Run + Azure Blob Storage**).
* Building scalable Python APIs and packaging them with Docker.
* Connecting a React frontend to a cloud-based backend.
* Applying AI to analyze social projects in a real-world scenario.
